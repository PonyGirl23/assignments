        <p>Bob Ross Ipsum Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. We'll throw some
            old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Every single thing in the world has its own personality
            - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.
            
            You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in
            your mind first. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.
        </p>

        <p>Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. I'm gonna start with a little
            Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? God gave you
            this gift of imagination. Use it. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let
            them happen. Have fun with it.
        </p>

        <p>That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Nothing's
            gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Isn't that fantastic
            that you can create an almighty tree that fast? We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really
            care.
        </p>

        <p>We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.
            In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy
            at his job.
        </p>

        <p>Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. In this world, everything can be happy. You can work and carry-on and put
            lots of little happy things in here.
        </p>

        <p>Now it's beginning to make a little sense. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Now
            we'll take the almighty fan brush. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. It just happens - whether
            or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.
        </p>
