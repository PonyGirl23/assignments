            <h2>How I wonder what you are.</h2>
            <p>What is a star?</p>
            <p>A star is a big ball of gas. It is not star-shaped. Stars give off heat and light.</p>
            <p>How is a star made?</p>
            <p>Stars are born in nebulas. Nebulas are clouds found in space. They are made of gases and dust.</p>
            <p>A star's color tells us how hot or cold it is. The bluish stars are the hottest ones. The reddish stars
               are the coolest. But they are still very hot!</p>
            <p>Our sun is a yellow star. That makes it one of the cooler stars.</p>
            <p>The sun looks very big to us. But it is just a medium-sized star. The sun looks so big because it is
                close to the Earth. </p>

            <h2>Now I know just what you are.</h2>
